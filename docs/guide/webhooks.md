# Webhooks

Webhooks let CometCMS notify an external URL whenever content changes. The primary use case is triggering SSG (static site generator) rebuild jobs — but any HTTP endpoint can receive these events.

## Configuration

Webhooks are configured in the **Webhooks** page of the admin (under **System → Webhooks**). Each webhook has:

| Field          | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **URL**        | The HTTPS endpoint that will receive POST requests.          |
| **Secret**     | A shared secret used to sign the payload. Keep this private. |
| **Trigger on** | The subset of events that should fire this webhook.          |

You can configure multiple webhooks, each listening to a different set of events.

## Events

| Event                 | Fired when …                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content.created`     | A new entry is saved for the first time.                |
| `content.updated`     | An existing entry is saved.                             |
| `content.published`   | An entry transitions to `published` status.             |
| `content.unpublished` | A previously published entry leaves `published` status. |
| `content.deleted`     | An entry is soft-deleted (moved to trash).              |
| `content.restored`    | An entry is restored from the trash.                    |

## Payload format

Every webhook request is an HTTP **POST** with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "event": "content.published",
  "occurred_at": "2025-05-03T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "type": "posts",
    "id": "7K4p9xQ2mR",
    "slug": "my-first-post"
  }
}
```

- `event` — the event name from the table above.
- `occurred_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp in UTC.
- `data.type` — the collection name (e.g. `posts`, `pages`).
- `data.id` — the stable opaque ID of the affected entry.
- `data.slug` — the URL-safe slug of the affected entry. Use either `id` or `slug` to fetch the entry from the Public API.

::: tip Lightweight by design
The payload intentionally contains only the event and a reference to the entry. Use the Public API to fetch the full entry if your handler needs the content.

## Signature verification

Every request includes an `X-CometCMS-Signature` header. Its value is:

```
sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 hex digest>
```

The signature is computed over the **raw request body** using your webhook secret as the key. Always verify this signature before processing the event.

### Node.js

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");

function verifySignature(rawBody, secret, signature) {
  const expected =
    "sha256=" +
    crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(rawBody).digest("hex");
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected), Buffer.from(signature));
}
```

### PHP

```php
function verifySignature(string $rawBody, string $secret, string $signature): bool {
    $expected = 'sha256=' . hash_hmac('sha256', $rawBody, $secret);
    return hash_equals($expected, $signature);
}
```

### Python

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_signature(raw_body: bytes, secret: str, signature: str) -> bool:
    expected = 'sha256=' + hmac.new(
        secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```

## Example: triggering a Netlify build

1. In Netlify, go to **Site settings → Build hooks** and create a new hook. Copy the hook URL.
2. In CometCMS, open **Webhooks** and add a webhook with:
   - **URL** — your Netlify hook URL
   - **Secret** — any random string (Netlify doesn't verify signatures, but CometCMS sends one regardless)
   - **Trigger on** — `content.published`, `content.unpublished`
3. Publish or unpublish a post — Netlify will start a new build automatically.
