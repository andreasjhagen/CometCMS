# Media Library

## Uploading files

1. Click **Media** in the sidebar.
2. Click **Upload** and select one or more files.

Supported formats include JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, SVG, AVIF, MP4, WebM, QuickTime/MOV, M4V, AVI, MKV, common audio formats, archives, and common document types.

## Organising with categories

Use a file's menu or detail panel to assign it to a category. Categories help you keep large libraries organised. Categories can be nested for finer-grained organisation, for example `Brand / Logos` or `Products / Campaigns`.

## Alt text and title

Open any file to reveal the detail panel. You can set:

- **Alt text** — a short description used by screen readers and as the `alt` attribute in HTML.
- **Title** — an optional tooltip shown when a user hovers over the image.

Both fields are included in the public API response and are saved automatically when you leave the field.

## Visibility

Each file can be set to **Public** (default) or **Private**:

- **Public** — the file is served to everyone and appears in unauthenticated API responses.
- **Private** — the file is hidden from unauthenticated `GET /api/v1/media` responses, and fetching the file directly via `GET /media/{filename}` requires a bearer token with `media.read` permission for that file.

Change visibility in the detail panel or use the bulk **Set field → Visibility** action to update multiple files at once.

## Using media in content

Fields of type `media` let you pick a file from the media library directly within the content editor.

## Accessing media files

Uploaded files are served from:

```
/media/{filename}
```

## Deleting files

Select a file and click **Delete**. This permanently removes the file and its metadata.
