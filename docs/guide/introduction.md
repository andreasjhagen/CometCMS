# Introduction

CometCMS is a lightweight, **file-based headless CMS** built with PHP and a Vue 3 admin interface. It requires no database — all content, users, and settings are stored as plain JSON files on disk.

## Key concepts

| Concept           | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content type**  | A schema that defines either a collection of entries (e.g. `posts`) or one single page-like entry (e.g. `start-page`). |
| **Content entry** | A saved item made up of the fields defined by its content type.                                |
| **Media**         | Uploaded images/files, managed through the media library.                                      |
| **User**          | A person who can log in to the admin panel. Users receive permissions through their assigned role. |
| **API token**     | A bearer token that grants headless API access with specific permission grants.                |

## Roles

| Role     | Permissions                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin`  | Built-in full-access role. It cannot be deleted.                                  |
| `editor` | Built-in content and media editing role.                                          |
| `viewer` | Built-in read-oriented role.                                                      |

Roles can be customized or created from **Users → Edit user roles**.
