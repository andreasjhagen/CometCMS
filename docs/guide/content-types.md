# Content Types

A **content type** defines the structure (schema) for content. Most content types are collections of entries, such as `posts`. A content type can also be marked as a **single page** for one-off content like `start-page`, `contact-page`, or `imprint`.

## Creating a content type

1. In the sidebar, click **Content types**.
2. Click **New content type**.
3. Enter a **name** (e.g. `posts`). The name is used as the collection identifier in the API — use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
4. Choose the **Content model**:
   - **Collection** for repeatable content with many entries.
   - **Single page** for one fixed entry.
5. Add fields (see [Field Types](./field-types)).
6. Optional: add locales and choose a default locale.
7. Click **Save**.

Single page content types appear under **Single** in the sidebar and open directly in the editor. Their entry slug is fixed to the content type name, so a `start-page` single page is fetched at `/api/v1/content/start-page/start-page`.

## Editing a content type

Open an existing content type to add, reorder, remove fields, or set supported field defaults. Changes to the schema do not affect existing entries — old entries simply won't have the new field value until they are edited and saved.

Field defaults pre-fill new entries in the admin editor and are applied to API-created entries when the field is omitted.

You can change a collection to a single page only when it has at most one active entry. This avoids ambiguity about which existing entry should become the fixed page content.

## Localization

Content types can define `locales` and a `default_locale`. Leave locales empty to disable multi-language editing for that type.

Localized entries store translated `title` and custom field values per locale. Slug, status, author, publish date, timestamps, and entry ID are shared by all locales.

Changing locale settings is non-destructive:

- Adding a locale makes it available for future translations. Existing entries show it as missing until an editor saves that locale.
- Enabling localization for an existing non-localized content type copies each entry's root content into the new default locale.
- Removing a locale hides it from the editor and from `?locale=` resolution, but saved translation data is kept in storage.
- Changing the default locale updates existing entries to use that locale as their fallback root value when a translation exists.
- Disabling localization keeps existing translation data in storage, but the admin and API use the shared root values until localization is enabled again.

## Deleting a content type

Deleting a content type also removes all entries in that collection. This action is irreversible.

## Content type schema (JSON)

Content types are stored in `cms/storage/content-types/{name}.json`. A typical schema looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "posts",
  "label": "Posts",
  "singleton": false,
  "locales": ["en", "de"],
  "default_locale": "en",
  "fields": {
    "title": { "type": "text", "required": true },
    "slug": { "type": "slug", "required": true, "unique": true },
    "body": { "type": "markdown", "label": "Body", "default": "Start writing..." },
    "published": { "type": "boolean", "label": "Published", "default": false },
    "published_at": { "type": "datetime", "label": "Publish date" }
  }
}
```
