# CometCMS Migrator for WordPress

This WordPress plugin migrates public WordPress post types into CometCMS through the CometCMS public REST API.

## Features

- Admin screen under **Tools > CometCMS Migrator**
- API key based connection to a CometCMS workspace. Use the CometCMS site root URL, for example `https://cms.example.com`, not `/admin/dashboard`.
- Batch migration for posts, pages, and other public post types
- Optional creation of missing CometCMS content types
- Featured image and attached media upload
- Advanced Custom Fields and ACF Pro field migration
- Repeatable updates using stored CometCMS entry IDs in WordPress post meta

## Required CometCMS Token Grants

Create an API token in CometCMS with grants for the target workspace:

- `schema.create` on `schema:*` if the plugin should create content types
- `schema.update` on `schema:*` if the plugin should add newly detected ACF fields to existing content types
- `content.create`, `content.update`, and `content.publish` on `content:*`
- `content.read` on `content:*` for update detection
- `media.upload` and `media.update` on `media:*` when migrating media

## Default Schema

For each enabled WordPress post type, the plugin creates a CometCMS content type with:

- `title`
- `slug`
- `wordpress_id`
- `wordpress_type`
- `excerpt`
- `content`
- `featured_image`
- `attachments`
- `original_url`

WordPress content is stored as HTML in the `content` textarea field.

## ACF Support

When ACF migration is enabled, the plugin reads field objects from each migrated post and adds missing fields to the CometCMS content type.

Native mappings:

- text-like fields -> `text`
- textarea and WYSIWYG -> `textarea`
- number and range -> `number` / `range`
- true/false -> `boolean`
- select, radio, button group, checkbox -> `select`
- date and date-time pickers -> `date` / `datetime`
- color picker -> `color`
- image, file, and gallery -> `media`
- repeater -> `repeater` with mapped subfields

Flexible content, group, clone, relationship, post object, taxonomy, user, and link are stored as `json`.
