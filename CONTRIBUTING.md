# Contributing to CometCMS

## Local Development

PHP 8.2+ and Node 18+ must be installed locally. No Composer or database needed.
I'm primarily a JavaScript developer so the setup is done with npm scripts and Makefile commands, but the PHP code is vanilla and does not require a local server to run tests or build.

```bash
npm install   # install workspace dependencies
make dev      # start PHP + Vite together
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/admin`. The first visit shows the setup screen.

## Build for production

```bash
make build
```

This assembles a deployment-ready `dist/` folder containing the PHP CMS, compiled admin UI in `dist/admin/`, config, rewrite files, and clean storage placeholders. Upload the contents of `dist/` to your server; production does not need Node.

## Testing

Run the full local test suite before shipping:

```bash
make test
```

That command lints PHP and Vue files, runs the Composer-free backend tests in `tests/php`, and runs the Vue/Vite unit tests with Vitest. For the same verification CI performs before a release build, run:

```bash
make ci
```

You can also run the layers independently:

```bash
make test-backend
make test-frontend
npm --workspace web run test:watch
```

## Local reset

To wipe all data and return to the setup screen, just delete the storage folder. If you want to keep users and roles but reset content, media, sessions, logs, and settings, run:

```bash
rm -f cms/storage/users/*.json
rm -f cms/storage/roles/*.json
rm -rf cms/storage/workspaces/*
rm -f cms/storage/sessions/*
rm -f cms/storage/logs/*.log
rm -f cms/storage/backups/*.zip
rm -rf cms/storage/updates/*
rm -f cms/storage/settings.json
```

## Pull Requests

1. Ensure your fork is up to date with the `main` branch.
2. Run `make ci` to verify everything passes before opening a PR.
3. Write a clear PR description explaining what your changes do and why.
4. Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per pull request.

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug or have a feature request? Open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andreasjhagen/CometCMS/issues). Please include:

- A clear, descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Expected vs. actual behavior.
- Screenshots or error logs where helpful.

## Code Style

- **PHP:** PSR-12 inspired. The test suite includes a lint step that validates basic formatting.
- **Vue / JavaScript:** ESLint via the `web` workspace. Run `npm --workspace web run lint` before committing.
- Keep it simple. CometCMS intentionally avoids frameworks, compilers, and complex abstractions on the PHP side.
